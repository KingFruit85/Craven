SAVE LEVELS, PLAY SHOULD RESUME FROM LAST LEVEL LOADED

sound
-randomise sounds

R1 is clipping into other rooms, probably need to add a destroyer to it



if player killed on one shot you cannot jump host, enemy that killed you has to be of an equivalant level

what changes when the level changes

if killed by boss exit should still spawn


Ghosts

- Should knock you back to keep you at range

---------------------------------------------
Ghost boss

teleports away if the player gets too close
must be stunned with arrows then attacked

at 50% health gets faster

at 25% gets faster (and maybe splits?)

arrows will spawn at random in the boss room
