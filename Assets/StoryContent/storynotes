Item #: KRVN-0 Initial discovery
Overview: Specimen was retrieved from impact site ██████ on the ██/██/████. Its exotic material properties have proved difficult to analyse via traditional methods.

Description: KRVN-0 is an exactly 100ml volume of inert black non-Euclidean liquid. Samples taken from the Specimen quickly revert to pure water making chemical analysis difficult. The Specimen was observed to recover it’s lost mass between approximately 5 - 20 minutes after the failed sample was taken via some yet unknown mechanism.

Addendum: Dr.███████ has instructed that only non-destructive/invasive methods of analysis and experimentation are performed on KRVN-0 while further sample exploration and discovery are ongoing at site ██████.

Object Status: Safe.

Item #: KRVN-0 
Test #1 description: The original volume of liquid is placed in a drum centrifuge with a transparent casing. The volume is spun up to 7,500 RPM. No component separation was able to be observed, liquid was spread extremely thin but remained completely opaque to molecular observation.
Centrifuge was powered down and original volume was returned to its storage container.

Item #: KRVN-0 
Observation #1: Junior lab technician ██████ claims that the volume of liquid displaced itself to gather at the side of its storage container nearest to ██████ when they were taking inventory at ██/██/██ ██:██:██. CCTV footage shows the liquid at its normal resting state before and after ██████ obscures the camera with their body.
Name has been nominated for random drug screening.

Item #: Junior lab technician ██████
Observation #1:Random drug screening returned negative for all standard psychotropic drugs. Dr ███ reported that Junior lab technician ██████ was uncharacteristically dispondent during the testing.
